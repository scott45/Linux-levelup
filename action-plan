Fellow understands the use of commands in a Unix environment and has experience writing scripts. 

However, basic concepts of a Linux environment that she struggled with are a must for a DevOps Engineer. She could not correctly respond to questions based on linux such as the Linux directory structure and Linux directory ownership and permissions among others. 

She also struggled for a larger part of the practical session attempting to fix an issue around privilege escalation and directory ownership. 

Action plan 

- Complete a short Linux course focused on linux essentials, file- system, directory structure and the command-line.
- Go through Linux privilege escalation on user and administrative accounts. After this, you should be able to go through deployments understanding directory ownership etc. with very little or no troubles.
